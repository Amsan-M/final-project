<h2>Course Overview</h2>

C: drive of a lab computer will be erased after the computer power is cycled.
</p>
<p>
Options For Saving Files:
</p>
<p>	Use BCIT Sharefile to save your work</p>
<p>	Save your work to your personal USB or cloud storage account</p>
<p> Use your own laptop in class, and dont use the BCIT lab computers</p>


<h2>Orientation: Course Materials</h2>
<p>COMP 1950 homework assignments, quizzes, in class exercises and example code can be accessed via Desire 2 Learn (D2L). 
    Use your BCIT student number and password to access D2L. 
    Course materials will become avilable as the course progresses. 
    It is your responsibility to log in and download files as they become available.
If you have difficulty gaining access, consult the D2L help documentation, or contact BCIT Tech help desk 
at 604-412-7444 (Toll free: 1-800-351-5533).
</p>

<h2>Orientation: Web space</h2>
<p>Each student will get a personal webspace where you will publish your homework assignments. 
    This is not a continuation of your COMP1850 site (if you had one). 
    This site is primarily for you to house your exercises, assignments and group work. Make it a site that is usable and functional.
</p>
<p>Your instructor will create webspaces for each of you.</p>
<p>Email your instructor this information:</p>
<p>your myBCIT email - eg: yourname123@my.BCIT.ca</p>
 <p>your student number - eg: A00123456</p>
<p>a case sensitive password you will remember - ???</p>
<p>Take the name portion of your my.bcit.ca email address and use it at the end of the URL described below
(eg: if your email address is 'yourname123@my.bcit.ca', your email name is 'yourname123', so your url would be 'http://bcitcomp.ca/students/yourname123'</p>
<p>For example: http://bcitcomp.ca/students/your_bcit_email_name</p>
